API Specification
----------------


Overview
--------
OpenAPI / Swagger files can become very large, especially for a system like HETS that has numerous entities and a rich API.  A method to allow the API definition to be easily edited is required to minimize human error, and increase accessibility to editing the specification.

Setup
-----
Before you can make changes to the API Spec you will need the following installed on your computer:
- Microsoft Windows:  Used to run the various elements of the specification assembly system.  Windows 10 Pro is recommended.
- git: required to clone the project repository and commit changes.
- Microsoft Excel:  Office 365 / Excel 2016 is version currently used to edit the Excel file.
- python 2.7: required to convert .CSV to .JSON
- mustache: required to convert .JSON to .YAML.  The Node.js implementation of mustache is recommended; other variants may not support the specific syntax used in the mustache files for this project.

Excel Input
-----------
The Excel master file is located at the repository location APISpec/in/HETSSwagger.xlsm

Macros are used in the file, so must be enabled after loading the file into Excel.

In order to provide an easy interface to editing the data, an Excel spreadsheet is used.  This spreadsheet has the following sheets in it:

- defs.csv: model definitions.  One row per entity column.
- paths.csv: API paths.  One row per endpoint.
- model.csv: Converts defs.csv to a model definition.
- api.csv: Converts paths.csv to a API definition.


Export From Excel
-----------------
Once all changes to the Excel spreadsheet have been completed, the contents of the excel spreadsheet will need to be exported.  The keyboard sequence CTRL-V can be used to run a macro which will rapidly save each sheet tagged for export as a CSV file.

The specific macro that key combination calls is Save2CSV; it simply loops through the sheets in the workbook and saves each sheet with a name ending in .csv to a .csv file.

Custom Swagger Sections
-----------------------
A provision is available for custom sections in Swagger.  This allows for uncommon API paths, user view models and other material that is not generated from the excel data.

Special files are:
- header.yaml: Text that appears at the top of the swagger file.  Typically includes the license, project name and other details.
- postapi.yaml:  Custom paths that will go below the generated API paths.  Often used for special services that are not common patterns.
- footer.yaml: Text that appears at the bottom of the swagger file.  May include view models, security definitions and other text that goes below the model definition. 

Swagger File Assembly
--------------------------
The file "update.bat" is a batch file which processes the output of the Export From Excel step.

Simply execute the command "Call update.bat" from the directory.  The update batch file is also often called by a higher level code generation batch file, which both updates the Swagger file and generates code from it.

The update.bat file does the following:

1) Convert the .CSV files generated by the Export From Excel step to .JSON

2) Using Mustache templates with the JSON data as an input, generate .YAML fragments for the model and API paths

3) Combine the generated .YAML fragments with static hand edited fragments into one large OpenAPI file.

Committing Changes
------------------
It is recommended that only changes to the input files and the final .YAML file be added to the repository.

There is no need to commit the various temporary files generated during file assembly.

Check Constraints
-----------------
Check constraints are not supported by the following:
- Excel spreadsheet
- YAML format OpenAPI specification
- Code generated from the OpenAPI specification
- Entity Framework

As such, if there is a special requirement to have a check constraint, they can only be added through a custom database migration.  This is a manual process done by a software developer.

Note that a check constraint added in this manner is unknown to Entity Framework, and so if any changes are made by Entity Framework to a model object containing such a constraint, it is quite likely automatically generated migrations involving changes to that object will fail (as Entity Framework is not aware of the check constraint).

Migrations that do not involve any changes to an object containing constraints or other hand made additions would not be affected.  

The best practice with any migration is to test before deployment, and only deploy if the migration is successful in the test environment.

Troubleshooting
---------------
Common problems are:
- Invalid characters in the CSV/JSON/YAML files cause the file assembly or code generation to fail.
- Mismatched object relationships in the definitions

The fastest way to troubleshoot these sort of issues is to load the output file into a Swagger Editor and make note of issues the Swagger Editor reports.  Problems should always be addressed by editing the excel file, unless if the problems are occurring in the static include files.

In the event that the input data is unparsable, and no output file is created, review the output from the update command and correct problems by editing data in the Excel spreadsheet or static input files.
